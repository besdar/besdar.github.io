Each micro-frontend was initialized within a dedicated portal, combining to form a personalized page with user data and management tools for clients. The project leveraged the latest versions of React, TypeScript, and other JavaScript libraries. As a key contributor to the project&#x27;s early stages, I played a pivotal role in shaping its architectural decisions and led the development of the most complex micro-frontend modules. Additionally, I mentored fellow frontend developers, helping to drive the project&#x27;s success.</p><p>A long-term project utilizing modern technologies like React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Kotlin was designed to deliver a robust and scalable solution. The project had a strict test coverage policy, which ensured the development of a comprehensive testing framework. This framework included unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, allowing the team to ensure the quality and reliability of the solution. As a full-stack developer, I worked on both the frontend and backend, utilizing Kotlin to develop the backend API and integrating it with the frontend components. My involvement in this project allowed me to develop my skills in writing effective tests and engaging in discussions with the frontend team on best practices for testing.</p><p>A large-scale, monolithic project with over 100 team members presented a unique set of challenges, including working with a mix of outdated and modern technologies, such as TypeScript, vanilla JavaScript, React, plain HTML and CSS, Java, and other backend technologies. Despite these complexities, the project required careful planning, collaboration, and effective communication to drive positive change. As a contributor to this project, I successfully navigated the process of updating legacy code, convincing stakeholders of necessary changes, and participating in cross-team refactoring initiatives, developing my skills in collaborating with large teams, managing technical debt, and working with multiple technologies.</p></details></p><p class="history-tech-stack tech-stack"><span class="tech-stack-title">Stack: ​</span><span class="tech-stack-item" aria-label="show more" role="button" tabindex="0">TypeScript,</span> <span class="tech-stack-item" aria-label="show more" role="button" tabindex="0">React,</span> <span class="tech-stack-item" aria-label="show more" role="button" tabindex="0">Jest&amp;RTL,</span> <span class="tech-stack-item" aria-label="show more" role="button" tabindex="0">Java&amp;Kotlin,<span class="tech-stack-item tooltip">When it was necessary, I worked with backend projects and these were new languages for me</span></span> <span class="tech-stack-item" aria-label="show more" role="button" tabindex="0">GraphQL<span class="tech-stack-item tooltip">I have created couple of GraphQL requests in an exiting project</span></span> </p></div></div></section><section class="history description-item"><div class="history-list"><h3 class="history-company-name"><a class="link" title="Foxford (EdTech)" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://foxford.ru/" target="_blank">Foxford (EdTech)</a></h3><span class="history-dates">2021 - 2022</span></div><div class="history-description"><h3 class="history-title">Frontend developer</h3><div class="history-about"><ul class="history-achivements achivements"><li class="achivements-item">Started a code review process for the team, was an organizer of weekly frontend meetings</li><li class="achivements-item">Proposed many new rules to the ESLint to make it stricter in the project, integrated Stylelint, created code style guides for the team.
